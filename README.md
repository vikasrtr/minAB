# minAB
A minimalist A/B testing framework for python

minAB was designed as a simple project to understand the process of randomized selection of visitors in a A/B test and record events as they occur

# Usage
Run the Flask demo `ab_test_demo.py` to see a working process.
Before running, ensure a `Redis Server` running on `localhost`  with default port, although you can edit the configuration to change ip and ports

# Requirements
 - Python 3
 - Redis
 - Flask (for demo)
